# SharkPlunge
## A 3D Python game that uses the pygame and OpenGL libraries.
### The core gameplay loop revolves around shooting a shark with a plunger.
### As you defeat a shark a new shark will show up, which will be faster than the last one, before this new shark shows up you will have an arrow indicating where it will appear from to aid you.
### You also have a dash mechanic to defend yourself.
### If the Shark reaches you, you will lose one of your hearts until you eventually run out of them.
### The game's models were made from scratch. The game has collision detection, a menu, a clear gameplay loop and a shark that will follow you wherever you go.
